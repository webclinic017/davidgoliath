# series relationships / predict future values -> trading signals

# Time series contain: give inference or predictions
# 1. Trends. (eg: in commodities prices)
# 2. Seasonal Variation: growing seasons/ temperature/ commodities
# 3. Serial Dependence: serial correlation - Volatility clustering

# forecast prices
# generate future scenarios, estimate the number of trades, expected returns ...
# spread with bid/ask volume and transaction costs???

# use R statistical libraries

# Bayesian statistics: time series and machine learning models

# modern models examining financial data across different assets

# Introduction

# Serial Correlation

# Random Walks and White Noise

# ARMA Models

# ARIMA and GARCH Models

# Cointegration

# State-Space Models: Kalman Filter, Hidden Markov Model

# autocorrelation
