# frequent behaviour modification
# macroeconomic effects: market regimes
# -> change means, variances, autocorrelation and covariances

# dynamically-varying correlation: excess kurtosis/ heteroskedasticity/
# skewed returns

# detect these regimes/ when a new regime has occurred ??? to adjusting
# strategy, risk management and position sizing

# Then we find Hidden Markov Model to solve this problem
# hidden and noisy

# Forward Algorithm. Viterbi Algorithm

# trading performance vs regime detection

# Markov Models: stochastic state space model - random states transitions
# jump probability dependent upon the current state,

# Markov Property: memoryless - an Eg: Random walk models
# 4 classes: Fully Observable/ Partially Observable
# vs Autonomous/ Controlled

# Markov Chain/: MC
# Hidden Markov Model/: HMM
# Markov Decision Process/: MDP
# Partially Observable Markov Decision Process/: POMDP

# MCMC algorithm

# Q-Learning: optimise the action-selection

# OpenAI gym

# time unit : ticks or bars of historical asset data.

# Markov Model Mathematical

# a Discrete-State Markov Chain (DSMC)

# define the n-step transition matrix

# Hidden Markov: states are now "hidden" from view
