# time series analysis models: autocorrelation

# seasonal variation, structure of correlations

# Expectation, Variance and Covariance, confidence-interval

# Expectation: mean

# variance: the "spread" of a random variable
# or expectation of the squared deviations of the variable from the mean

# Standard Deviation (std): of a random variable
# square root of the variance

# Covariance: between two random variables:
# how two variables move together

# Correlation
# "expectation, variance, standard deviation, covariance and correlation"

# Stationarity in Time Series:
# stationary (constant) Mean
# stationary Variance

# Serial Correlation and lag
# Second Order Stationary

# Autocovariance of a Time Series (tự Phương sai)
# Autocorrelation of a Time Series (Tự tương quan)
# mối quan hệ giữa một biến và phiên bản trễ của nó trong các
# khoảng thời gian khác nhau

# correlogram: plot of the autocorrelation function

# linear models/ non-linear models and forecasting

# Random Walks and White Noise Models
# linear stochastic models: mô hình ngẫu nhiên tuyến tính.
# serial correlation: tương quan nối tiếp

# to predict direction and volatility

# summarise the general process
# 1. Outline a hypotheis
# 2. Obtain the correlogram and its serial correlation
# 3. reduce residuals
# 4. Refine to fit
# 5. first and second-order model??? forecasts future
# 6. loop (1:5) to optimize accuracy
# 7. create trading strategies

# Backward Shift (BSO) / Lag and Difference Operators:
# to code time series models and make comparisons

# non-stationary time series models: changable mean and variance
# non stationary series to stationary

# White Noise: Residual - Dư/ sót/ thừa
# concept: when fitting models, Residual Error Series(RES) occurs
# RES: difference between an observed value and a predicted value
# RES: independent distribution and uncorrelated

# Discrete White Noise(DWN): independent elements in a time series
# standard normal distribution vs Gaussian White Noise
# instead of a historical time series, create many histories
# rồi thống kê -> refine models, increase forecast accuracy

# second order properties(mean = 0, no autocorrelation) and correlogram

# Random Walk
