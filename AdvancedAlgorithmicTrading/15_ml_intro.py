# statistical analysis + computer science
# forecasting and prediction asset prices,
# optimising trading strategy parameters
# managing risk and detection of signals among noisy datasets

# algorithms learn from data

# simple traditional statistical models -> dnn

# Prediction trend
# Prediction liquidity
# NLP for sentiment

# Supervised Learning: labelled data
# -> categories/ numerical responses

# Unsupervised Learning: not all of labelled data
# -> structure of the data to identify patterns
# -> partition datasets into sub-clusters (eg similarly assets)

# and Reinforcement Learning: maximise a reward mechanism
# -> optimise investment portfolios

# Techniques:
# 1. Linear Regression
# 2. Linear Classification
# 3. Tree-Based Methods
# 4. Support Vector Machines
# 5. Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning
# 6. Bayesian Networks
# 7. Clustering
# 8. Dimensionality Reduction

# Applications
# 1. Forecasting and Prediction
# 2. NPL
# 3. Factor Models
# 4. Image Classification
# 5. Model Accuracy
# 6. Parametric and Non-Parametric Models
# 7. Statistical Framework for Machine Learning Domains
