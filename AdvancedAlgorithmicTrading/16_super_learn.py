# classification
# -> estimating membership of a set of features into a particular
# categorical group.
# -> predicting whether an asset will rise or fall in price the
# following day, based on N days of asset price history.

# regression:
# -> estimating a real-valued response from a set of features
# -> predict the actual value of an asset in the following day
# from its past price history

# Mathematical Framework
# 1. 'FUNCTION estimation' which "best" approximates
# 2. 'PROBABILISTIC formulation': estimating the form of a
# 'probability distribution' or 'conditional density estimation'
# or 'conditional probability distribution'
# highest probability is the best guess

# Classification
# Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate

# Regression
# Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Random Forests.
# Eg: estimate future asset prices in an intraday trading
