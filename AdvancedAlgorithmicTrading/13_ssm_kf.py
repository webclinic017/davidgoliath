# linear time series models: ARMA, ARIMA, and ...
# GARCH - conditional heteroskedasticity

# state space models: general class of models
# parameters can adapt over time.
# set of states: hedge ratio between two cointegrated pairs of equities

# Kalman Filter: algorithm for also quantitative finance
# update hedging ratios, statistical arbitrage pairs trade

# Prediction -> Filtering -> Smoothing
